# Lab 4 Tic Tac Toe

This is a console app that simulates the classic tic tac toe game with two players. The app prompts inputs from two different players, then each individual player could take turns inputting their coordinates on the game board.

The winner is determined by standard Tic Tac Toe rules. If the board is populated without a winner, a draw is outputted.
